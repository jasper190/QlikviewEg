Example of Qlikview case study to find causes of employee attrition rate, with IBM's public data


To study the employee population targeting the Dependant Variable as Attrition rate, where Attrition=’Yes’, 
the aim is to reduce the attrition rate, 
as employees are valuable assets to the company which take time to train and nurture to become skilled and efficient at their role,
which would ultimately increase the operating efficiency of the business


For that purpose, we group the factors into 3 clusters, 
1)	 The Demography of the employees, or variables like Age, Gender, Marital Status, and education which are
pre-disposed traits of the individual employees ( Sheet: Main ) 

2)	External Factors like Environment, Manager Rating, Performance, Years worked, Years with same manager,
No of companies worked for ( Sheet: Department )

3)	Motivation Factors, like Salary ,Job Role, Job Position, Stock Option level and % Salary Hike were
grouped together as Rewards ( Sheet: Reward )
